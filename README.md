# Introduction to Basic Statistics in R

This is the repository for the **bookdown** document that contains the
_Introduction to Basic Statistics in R_ created for employees at NORMENT who
want to make the switch from their current statistics software to R. It starts 
at the very basics and includes plotting, theory of statistics, and the writing
of scripts.
